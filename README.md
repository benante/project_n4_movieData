# project_movieData for Founders & Coders 

Website where you can check movies, sort them by different values, check their details (through a card) and add new movies.

Notes:
The searchbar was not implemented, it won't work.
The form to add movies won't really work because of the lack of a proper backend database (meaning what you add is only temporary during the session). 
However I added the cover of "Isle of Dogs" in the files to show how a new added movie would look like. The function to store the title is not case sensitive.
